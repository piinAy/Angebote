What you can do with it:
- create customers and products
- depending on what you've created, you'll see offers/recommendations
- created customers or products are each saved in a json file
- display all customers or products if available
- clear the view window
- edit or delete directly data rows in the data table
- search/filter in customers or products

Bugs to fix:
- view window is not always correct after deleting data rows

To Do's:
- add TextChanged to be able to save every change?
- also show the customer or the product above their recommendations
- re-add validations (adjusted)
